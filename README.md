# -Project-I-Databases
● Create a program that can be used by a bookstore clerk. The program
should allow the clerk to:
○ add new books to the database
○ update book information
○ delete books from the database
○ search the database to find a specific book.
● The program should present the user with the following menu:
1. Enter book
2. Update book
3. Delete book
4. Search books
0. Exit
The program should perform the function that the user selects. The
implementation of these functions is left up to you, but a demonstration of the
topics we have covered in the last module should be shown.
